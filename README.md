# sticky-notes-v2
## An app managing personal notes
### Comments about the creation of this app:
I used Vue - Vuex, Axios and Firebase, and created original artwork with Abode Illustrator. The theme is 80's style and the UI is minimalistic.

I used Vuex's namespacing which eliminates the need for separate file for variables, and made use of global components, navigation guards and Vue's transitions.
